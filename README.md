# Flex-box Image Grid
    
    > fles-wrap:
        To control how flex-item wrap and avoid any container overflow using the "flex-wrap" property 

        - The flex-items to expand and fill-up all the remaining space on each line, flex-box has some useful properties that work together with "flex-wrap" to help you with that:
            
            > flex-basis

            > flex-grow
    
    > flex-basis :
        It is similar to the width property and thats sets the initial mean size of a flex item.

            Ex: flex-basis: 220px

    > flex-grow:
        It grows and evenly fill-up the remaining white space.

            Ex: flex-grow: 1; 

    > flex-box provide a short-hand property called "flex" to set, thats lets us store "flex-basis" and "flex-grown" properties in one place.

        Ex: flex: 220px 1;

        **> There may take a optional 3rd value which is for "flex-shrink" which works for shrinking for images.

    > gap:
        We can use gap between flex images.
